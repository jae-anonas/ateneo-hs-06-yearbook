&writeup=In the midst of solitude is the silence of all things in the balance of elements… oooopppsss… why should seriousness, books, academics, and all be always attached to every honors class? Does it mean that students here are bunch of boring, corny, and nerdy ones? Definitely not! Our class gives a distinct orientation of an honors class and spells academic excellence differently. LG 4423 is composed of multi talented students excelling not simply in academics but also EQ. This is manifested in assisting our classmates’ difficulties in solving not only numerical problems in math and physics but also the real problems in life. The resilience of the class to recover from its failures and set backs also depicts its ability to surpass problems and high expectations. Our thoughts to perceive good things, despite failing grades of few students, sleepless nights in making projects, countable intrams losses, indicate how resilient we are by hurdling all the barriers to our success. Our class does not seek only for academic excellence but also for enjoyment while studying. We add humor, fun, and laughter as a way of alleviating boredom and difficulties encountered. Lastly, we have proven that we are also morally upright. Our unity and most disciplined award epitomize our character and virtue. With all these, LG 4423 defines academic excellence as doing one’s best rather than being the best.&
