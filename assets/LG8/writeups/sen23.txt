&dude=Jonathan S. Laxamana&
&writeup=Jonathan has been a very good to his classmates for the last four years. He has a strong, appealing and cheerful personality. This guy has the looks too. No wonder he has many chicks. He is a good leader, having been chosen the best platoon leader in the para-military training in Ateneo. He is indeed a smart guy because even though he doesn’t study that much he can manage to one of the second honors in our batch. - Claudio Miguel Francisco&
