&writeup=Louie has hundreds of jokes to make his friends and classmates grin. He has always made the class laugh without degrading the subject with his humor. But don’t ever make him angry because if you do, you need at least a month to make him cool down. This guy has also potential to be a good leader. But what is really worth appreciating in him is his being true to himself. - Jerome Tisoy&
