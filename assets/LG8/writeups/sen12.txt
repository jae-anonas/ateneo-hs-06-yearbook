&writeup= “Chinie,” as classmate and friends fondly call her is a typical girl one can find every morning with a smile on her face. In her, one sees a combination of sweetness, gentleness and kindness like that of Maria Clara’s. Problems or worries puzzling you my friend? Why not tell her these things because she’s a good listener. Indeed, good-natured Chinie is a blessing to her friends and family. - Lloyd Jon Bernardo&
