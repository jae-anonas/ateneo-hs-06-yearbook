&dude=Yul C. Araya&
&writeup=If Newton stands on the shoulder of giants, Yul stands on top of the world. He wields countless similes and metaphors but nothing exactly compares to who he is. He is distinctly Yul – sharp mind, gentle heart, and caressing utterance of words. Yet he proves wrong what Blaise Pascal thinks universally true. Yul’s heart has reasons that reason itself knows. – Doraemon&
