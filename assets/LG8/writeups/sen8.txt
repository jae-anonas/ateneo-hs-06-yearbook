&writeup=Yuri is a fun-loving, sweet and intelligent young lady. She likes jokes, having fun and chocolates. Some mistake her for her boyish acts, but she is really “girl” at heart. It’s her charm and energetic style that make her likeable. No wonder why most people easily get along with her. (love you po!) - Kenneth Peter Molave&
