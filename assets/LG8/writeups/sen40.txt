&writeup=Different people are created with different talents. These people would be very proud to show other people what these talents or abilities are which is true for almost all but for one. This person can be described as humble because even though he is very talented especially when it comes to numbers, he never forgets to keep all he’s achievement to himself unlike others who would be bragging of all their achievements to others. He is a friend who would make sure that you always start your day with a smile. He is known as “Buddha” or “the mathematician”. The first impressions of people towards him is a serious guy, they are certainly wrong. He is a person full of sense of humor. He is a great friend, a TRUE friend. - Ven Julio R. Requejo&
