&writeup=They say humility is a virtue and at the same time, an attitude. It’s hard to be humble, especially if you’re the Alpha Company Commander who led Ateneans to victory. It will be harder if you are a member of the Ateneo Basketball Varsity, with such achievements and victory, being humble is the hardest thing to do. Yet this guy boasts nothing… he’s just proud that he’s humble! - Roel Charles Padua&
