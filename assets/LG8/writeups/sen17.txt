&dude=Jonathan B. Del Castillo&
&writeup=Authoritative and clean is what you can associate with this man at a glance. Yes, that is true but he is also friendly and God-fearing type of guy who always likes to have fun, whose humor one can never compare with anything. Del is a dignified man who does everything he likes. He is an artist who is good in lettering and an athlete who is good at darts. He packs light and takes a lot of time grooming himself thus, never ask what takes him so long or if not why he is late. - Michael Iñigo&
