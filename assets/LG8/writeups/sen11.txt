&dude=Lloyd Jon G. Bernardo&
&writeup=This guy, weirdo sometimes, always starts his day with a smile. If ever you see him, for sure, you can’t avoid smiling. Sometimes you’ll get annoyed with his child-like attitude and for his being “makulit” but this is just his way saying he appreciates you very much. He’ll cheer you up whenever you’re down and help you find your way whenever you’re lost and be your true friend for the rest of your life. A really loyal friend and a true classmate that is Lloyd Jon Bernardo. - Jeli Frnaces L. Almoneda&
