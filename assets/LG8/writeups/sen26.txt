&dude=Antonio N. Mendez, Jr.&
&writeup=Here is one guy you definitely would meet and hang out with. A guy with a positive attitude, Tony is not just intelligent but also talented. He may be silent most of the time but when he speaks, he speaks of great ideas mixed with humor. His simplicity makes everyone feel comfortable with him. Tony is a person who gives importance and respect to his friends. - Jeffrey Ozawa&
