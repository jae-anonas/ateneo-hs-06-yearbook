&dude=Rodolfo M. Buena, Jr.&
&writeup=Rudolph, a man whose appearance may deceive you, is thin but a terrible guy. He can make the most of your time worthy. He is friendly and humorous. He can easily express his sensible thoughts and can as easily escape from the hassle they can cause, he sings like a songbird and acts like a diamond star. Aside from it all, he is a creative artist whose ability is beyond compare. - Micheal Iñigo&
