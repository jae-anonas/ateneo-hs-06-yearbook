&writeup=“All that I can do for my friend is to be myself, his friend.” Spending most a surreal high school life with Ralph, one can be very grateful and happy that someone likes him cross his way. Ralph, the silent nature lover, is one of the best persons that anyone could wish for. Expressive of his feelings and owning an artistic dexterous hand, Ralph painted all the colors that brought life to our high school experience. He is someone who has rocked our world and someone who will rock yours too! - Jason Chan&
