&writeup=Having a friend such as this person will surely make your life worth living. He is, as people would say, an intelligent person with an outstanding sense of humor. He never treats problem as if they were the end of his life, instead, he would give those problems a big smile and they will all fade away. He is a person who is always ready to lend a helping hand not only to his family and friends but to everyone who needs help. He is that person who does not feel happy or comfortable whenever people around him are in pain or are undergoing problems. He always wants everyone to feel happy. He is a person whom I can call a REAL friend. He is Arvin P. Aller.  - Ven Julio Requejo&
