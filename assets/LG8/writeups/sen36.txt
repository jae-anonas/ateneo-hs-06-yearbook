&writeup=In details: “ batang matampuhin! “best actress!” “inlove pirmi?!” “batang iyakin!” “paralatik!” “sweet racer…”%0Aa Cancer girl who sees herself as a strong-willed person unafraid to take risks. She laughs at everything but cries easily too. Her smile illumines the life of a weak soul, her tears consoles a grieving heart and her presence makes a lost cheneb secured. The moon rules her life, which is the water sign. She flows very quietly yet very deep. Yvete is know to be caring, emotional, sensitve, resistant to change, and home loving. She often has widely fluctuating moods and is much aware of what she feels than what she thinks. - Kaye Contreras&
