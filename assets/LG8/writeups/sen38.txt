&dude=Philip N. Talay&
&writeup=He considers practicality at all times. He believes that anything worth having is worth working hard for. He puts greater value to the things he wants to achieve to win it through. He puts focus on his responsibilities and considers life a serious business. He respects power, traditions, values and ideals, which have been tested by time. He is also ambitious and is not satisfied unless his objectives are met. In contrast with that, Philip also has a very carefree nature and simply giggles at anything. Keeping other’s secret is one of his job therefore his loyalty can never be doubted. - Yvete Marie Sola&
