&writeup=Smile… Smile… smile… it’s the first thing you’ll notice on her. A princess whose destiny is ruled by the air that flows softly along the surface. She can express herself easily about her emotions and desires. She places greater importance on learning than on emotional or practical issues. She is so interested in everything that she get easily bored and often can not resist on moving on to the next subject. She likes dressing up that standing out in the crowd is easy for her. - Yvete Marie Sola&
