&writeup=To you girls, if you want to meet a guy who’s tall, sensitive, generous and kind you should look for Tik. He is a good listener when you talk to him about your troubles or your fantasies. He is a cool guy who knows the city of Naga like the back of his hand. He spent most of his childhood on the streets of Naga looking and picking for fights. But that did not change his perspective about true love. Tik wishes that some day he would find the right girl who would accept him for who he is. And the girl would also be lucky to have him. -John Robert  Brioso&
