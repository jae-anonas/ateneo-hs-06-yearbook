&dude=John Robert U. Brioso &
&writeup=RJ is a mystery. He’s a cool guy who likes to try everything. He enjoys cooking and watching his favorite chefs on TV. He likes to play PC games, especially strategy games. He’s quiet and nice. He likes to hang out with simple people, and yet he wants to do something thrilling in the future. He wishes that in the future when he looks back he would say to himself that he really had a great time in high school and he really made the right choice in friends. - Richard Luis Ocampo&
