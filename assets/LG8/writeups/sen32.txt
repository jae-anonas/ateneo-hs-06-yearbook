&writeup=A humble guy, a caring brother, a responsible son and a great friend, that’s Mikko. With good sense of humor mixed with high level manner, he knows when to be serious and when to be silly. He is the type of student who gives his 99.9% on class and dedication to what he is doing. He is also willing to take risks and fears not failures; looks serious most of the time but is actually playful and funny. - Fulgentes Tatiana&
