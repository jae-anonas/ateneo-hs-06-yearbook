&dude=Jerrox Rey B. San Andres&
&writeup=The best seatmate one can ever had, Jerrox, a small but funny friend, is a one of a kind small joker that makes everyone laugh. He always considers himself as a “chick magnet” because of his killer but baby face. His most priced thing is his one-of-a-kind MotorolaC651 because he never lets anyone touch it and never leaves it. And most of all, he is a funk fanatic. He feels very proud to be taller than Arbie Ferrer. - Jude Anthony  Trinidad&
