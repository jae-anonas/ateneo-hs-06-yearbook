&writeup=E = mc2 is how most students think of this guy. Mic2 is a simple and nerd-looking guy with a weird personality. He has a sense of humor which often, though not intended offends the person involved. However, this guy is one person who keeps his cool despite criticisms, and other bad stuff which hinders him to hit the bull’s eye of success. - Tatiana Fulgentes&
