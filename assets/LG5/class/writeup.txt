&writeup=A class that never sleeps, a class that always gives. 4324 can easily be found in the school. Aside from the fact that 4324’s moderator is simply the best, the students within are also one of a kind. In this LG you can find many kinds of people, it’s like a place where every race meets. One of our LG’s very special characteristic is that were all straight, no student is between the line and undecided. 4324 have students that excel in co-curricular, sports and academics. Ateneo de Naga University is already coeducational that is why in 4324 there are also girls. In 4324 there are three girls, soon to be women some think. Well it is only in our LG that what matters is reality. Maybe it’s not that special, but truly our LG’s sense of being real motivated every single student to graduate. Though of course there are times of peril, 4324 will have to show others the prestige and all that was entitled by the school that reach more than high. In behalf of all 4324 colleagues, thank you Ateneo de Naga University, you’re simply more than the best.&
