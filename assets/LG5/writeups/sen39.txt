&writeup=This person is a man with a sense of humor, a guy that you can trust and a man with one word. Teodz is a person that you can trust and share nice things and even problems. This person lives up with the saying, “It’s better to be late than never”. I have known him since first year and no one of my most trusted friends. Everybody will agree of this inevitable fact: Teodz is one of the best lead guitarists. - Ciddfrey Saba&
