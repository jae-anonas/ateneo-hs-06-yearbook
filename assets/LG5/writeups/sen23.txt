&dude=Ian B. Junio&
&writeup=Ian is a kind of guy who could be described as a “phenomenon”. He’s not just popular as basketball machine but as an embodiment of friendliness and intense lafftrips. What we like about this guy is that he is never afraid to face any consequences or any challenge that he encounters. He never cares of what others think about him and he always choose a decision for the betterment of his companions rather than for himself, that’s our batch’s “El Rapido”. - Victor Gumabon&
