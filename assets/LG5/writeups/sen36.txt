&dude=Mark Kenneth C. Sarmiento&
&writeup=Mark is one of those who discipline themselves to achieve something they long for. He is best described as a “frank’ and “straight” person. Frank as he may be or whatever, it somehow solved many diversities and misunderstandings about friendship. His being fearless and confident in so many ways has made him versatile in whatever situation he’s on. Mark is famous for being an aggressive basketball player and for having a fair face, but the best of Mark is that he is a true friend. - Victor Gumabon&
