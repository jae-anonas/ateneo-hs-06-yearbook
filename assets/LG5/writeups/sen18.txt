&writeup=Michael is my bestfriend. He is gifted with almost everything yet he still remains as generous, humble, kind and friendly as ever. This handsome guy is a real gentleman and sometimes a joker. With his good looks, many girls would surely aim to be the patients and clients of this nurse someday. He is also a basketball fanatic. In fact, he is a good player and I think he can do anything because he is the best, and he believes in himself. - Pedro Andrew Beluang&
