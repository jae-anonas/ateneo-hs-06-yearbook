&writeup=There could be no other like him – he who personifies the giants of Mathematics, Philosophy and Fine Arts. What he has to offer are gifted intuition and snappy routing to correct answers during class discussions. Teachers love him (sometimes despise him) for he reads a lot. Consequently, he outwits everyone in the class.&
