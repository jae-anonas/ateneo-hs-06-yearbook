&writeup=Joan is my bestfriend. She helps me when I have problems. She also saves me whenever I get in trouble. She makes me laugh whenever I’m sad. She likes to draw. She also teaches me whenever I don’t understand our lessons. She excels in honor. She is a good student in our classroom since when we were in 2nd year. - Joan Gonzales&
