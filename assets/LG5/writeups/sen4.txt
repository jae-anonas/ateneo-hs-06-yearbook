&writeup=Boggz is very kind, industrious, friendly, and somewhat funny. He is a comforting son, brother, cousin, nephew and friend. Boggz is my bestfriend since grade three. I never knew that our friendship will last up to this time and I hope it will last forever. Our motto in life is “ I Love MAMA” because it is a sign of our respect, thanks, and love because we know that our mother gives everything to us, so we also give everything we have to our mothers. - Alfred Bryan Tria&
