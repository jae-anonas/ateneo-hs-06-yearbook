&writeup=When it comes to dancing, this guy is the first one to pop-up in my mind. But he does not limit himself to dancing, he also shows to a lot of Ateneans that he is a capable leader. Continue dancing for God and for others! A friend you can really keep because since elementary he has not closed his doors to anyone! - Gerard Edgar Surtida&
