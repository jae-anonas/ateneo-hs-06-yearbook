&dude=Francis Ian M. Dayao&
&writeup=Francis is a shy-silent man who is fond of computer games. He is sometimes a little geeky but he is a very good friend. And sometimes, he is the mood maker in our group. He can easily adopt to what kind of friends he has. Our group calls him “Mr. Dayao” and he’s the head of the food committee in our group such that he always gives us food in every practice game. He has a lot of patience and kind to almost all the people. He don’t talk much but when it’s time to get funky and lafftrips, he is good in showing his funny “whattamouth” and making funny and ridiculous sound effects. - Ralph Sales and Randy Dagooc&
