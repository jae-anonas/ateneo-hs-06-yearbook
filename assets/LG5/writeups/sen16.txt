&writeup=Lonlon is a guy with great confidence in dealing with girls. With his gentleness and charm, he seems to befriend every girl. But don’t be fooled by his convincing and amiable smiles, he got much more than that. He can also get you exasperated with his silly jokes. He might be annoying but you’d actually have a nice and sensible talk with him if you try. He can also be very good in keeping secrets. – Lonlon De la Torre&
