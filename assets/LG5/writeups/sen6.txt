&writeup=I don’t know anyone any jollier than this man! In fact, he’s the jolliest guy in the barkada. He has a voice like Sam Milby’s but only better and his skill with the guitar is exceptional. But what I really love about him is that he’s a true friend, someone you could really depend on, and he will never let you down. On top of that he’s an amazing, listener - you could talk to him and he’ll give you insights about the world that you do not even know of. Girl’s watch out, this guy is oozing with sex appeal. - Francis Verdadero&
