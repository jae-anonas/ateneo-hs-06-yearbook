&writeup=People call him Namé, a unique nickname that is enough to catch one’s attention. At first glance he looks like a stern-looking “chinito” but once you get acquainted with him, you’ll find him sensible, funny and charming. He is a genuine and a reliable friend. He loves his family dearly and his faith in God. He also plays the guitar very well and has a passion for music. - Rachelle Anne Bordado&
