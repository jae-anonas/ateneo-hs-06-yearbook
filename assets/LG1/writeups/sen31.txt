&writeup=Abet??? Words can’t describe this person. One thing’s for sure - he is like a brother to me. For the last four years, we have been playing soccer together, sharing secrets, laughters and tears. He is sometimes the backbone of our “tropa” because he always has a way of reading people. He is a real good friend. And that’s the truth… though he has some issues on girls. Don’t ever change. - Ralph Sales&
