&writeup=Adam Belarmino, what a name! Adam Belarmino is one of the best persons I’ve ever met in Ateneo. He is a very good example of a friend and classmate of mine for two years. Adam is a very good person because of his kindness, generosity, wisdom and good manners. As I leave Ateneo, I’ll never forget about the memories I’ve had and I will cherish them for in this school. Adam, goodluck and congratulations, hope you’ll succeed in the future. - Mar Henrick Savilla&
