&writeup=Ken fits the description of a tall, dark and handome lad… (and lanky too!) At first glance, he doesn’t seem the sporty type of guy but he already has proven his might in an off-road competition when he bagged the championship title in a recent competition. He also plays billiards and basketball.&
