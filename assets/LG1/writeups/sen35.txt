&writeup=Many people would ask him how he became too tall. He is known in school as the tallest student in Batch 2006. A kind, helpful and friendly person with great determination to reach his goals in life, Kimpee always wears a smile in his face and knows how to deal with people. He’s also a person who always strives for the best and never stops until he reaches the top. - John Dominic Delfin&
