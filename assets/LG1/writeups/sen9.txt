&dude=Juve-Joy Q. Bermudo&
&writeup=Simple and smart is what I would say about this girl. She’s willing to help her friends in whatever way she can and loving to those close to her. A shoulder to cry on, understanding and “mapagbigay” in many ways, she’s multi-talented and skillful especially in debate and sports. Prone to becoming a leader and always puts others before herself. Despite her short built, this girl is strong willed and knows her way out of any obstacle. Go guidon! - Martin Bea&
