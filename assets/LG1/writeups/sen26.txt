&dude=Bernardo B. Prila, Jr.&
&writeup=BJ is a kind of guy that no one can resist. He got the looks, style and an attitude of a joker. Despite being funny, BJ is a well-mannered and focused person, he has always overcome the odds. He has not only proven his academic skills but also his gracefulness in basketball. BJ would be remembered for his undying loyalty to his friends, he’d rather suffer than betray his fellows. What a guy, what a friend… - Victor Gumabon&
