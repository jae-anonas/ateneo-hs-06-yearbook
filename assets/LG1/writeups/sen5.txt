&dude=Jefford M. Balote&
&writeup=There are two words that can describe Jefford - smart and friendly. He is a funny guy that makes all his classmates laugh. He is good on his studies, in fact he is one of the honorable mention in our class, and he is good in physics. We will never forget “Balote” a.k.a. “Ford” till the end of the universe. – Jerico Ruizo&
