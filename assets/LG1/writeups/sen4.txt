&writeup=Abba is very friendly especially to his fellow Ateneans even if he doesn’t know them. He is a funny guy sometimes when he is in the right mood, but sometimes rude when he had problems in his life. This guy is very good in billiards and good in befriending girls that’s why he has many “girl-friends”. This guy is loyal to his “one and only”, and one can describe him as a very serious person when it comes to “love-life”. - Bruce San Vicente&
