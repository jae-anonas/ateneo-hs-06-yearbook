&writeup=I describe my friend as a meek and gentle person. Sweet and thoughtful, Pampie is very neat and clean especially in his work and in his room. He is thrifty and does not spend his money in worthless things. And most of all, Pampie is a religious person, because he participates all the time religious programs in our parish.&
