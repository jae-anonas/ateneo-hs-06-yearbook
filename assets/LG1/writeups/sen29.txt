&writeup=Ralph is very friendly to people but don’t you ever try to abuse his kind personality and make fun of his emotional feelings because you might find yourself lying on the ground unconscious. Ralph is a lovable person.He is known as the “Drama King” in our group. He may even qualify to be an Oscar Best Performance of Actor. Although Ralph is quite emotional, he is a good friend. You can count on him for support. - Randy C. Dagooc, Francis Ian M. Dayao&
