&writeup=“Winner” would be the best word to describe Victor. He is one of the greatest icons in school. He’s tall, dark and handsome, splendid basketball player and a wise student as well. Everyone likes Victor, not because of his achievements or being an icon in the campus but of his friendliness, concern and humility. That makes him a winner. - Gerard Edgar Surtida&
