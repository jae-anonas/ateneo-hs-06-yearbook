&dude=Chill Adrianne G. Bandales&
&writeup=Chill is just one of the typical guys in Ateneo. Tall, dark and uhmm… Handsome but he’s more than just that. At times, he can be very serious and sarcastic but often times you can see him laughing and fooling around. He’s a friend that you can lean on, when you’re down, he’d be there to make you laugh by his corny jokes and he’ll sing for you even if he’s out of tune. When he flashes a smile at you, your sadness would fade away. - Mayrelle Frances Isidoro&
