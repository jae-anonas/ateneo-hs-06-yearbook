&writeup=When I hear the name of this funny, cute guy, I laugh or just smile. You want to know why? Because this guy or I may say “girl-looking” friend of mine may let you feel so happy at all times. He is always there for you and would not leave you behind. When he loves someone, expect that he can do impossible things. He may always look smiling but he can also be too bad. Kidding aside, if you are John Raymund’s friend you could always count on him. Trust me. - Joanne Kristel  Camalla&
