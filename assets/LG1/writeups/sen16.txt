&dude=Arnel B. Ditan Jr.&
&writeup=Arnel is one of the nicest person I’ve ever met. He loves to watch Knowledge Channel which boosts his “IQ”. He is humble, simple good looking guy, who loves his family most. He is the junior of the family and is exquisitely a look-alike of his father. - Hermie Agricula&
