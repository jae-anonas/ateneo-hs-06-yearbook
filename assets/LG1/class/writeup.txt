&writeup=The class may be chaotic, but knows now to be serious in the most Jovial way. With a unity that stands out especially during class projects, there is no wonder why we never fail to surprise our dear teachers. They may say that we do grow physically but not mentally, but this class still finds its way around any obstacle in the most mature way possible. Sharing moments of happiness and misery, the friendship is strengthened as always. And every heart in this class remains true to all throughout the passing days.&
