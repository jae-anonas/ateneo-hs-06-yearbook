&writeup=Funky. Feminine. When she’s dressed up to go out, she’s seriously cool. She deals heroically with life’s challenges. Though pleasantly sluggish, she dances to her heart’s consent. Generally, she is lovingly and apparently distant, when hurt and betrayed; gullibly astute with the matters of the heart; fervently different, when standing up for something she believes in.&
