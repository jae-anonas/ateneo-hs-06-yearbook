&writeup=This guy is my friend. He is intelligent and often acts as a comedian. In our group, he serves as an icebreaker that enables us to unite. He is also good in playing basketball although he focuses more on studying than playing basketball. He’s good on girls but bad on boys.  - Jimark Perez&
