&dude=Jahnsen R. Serrano&
&writeup=This kid, Jahnsen, I’ve known him since 3rd year. He’s a fun-loving guy and all about mischief. He’s just an ordinary stude with average grades. He gives his best in everything he does especially in his studies. He’s a loyal friend and faithful son to his parents. He’s a faithful boyfriend to his girl Nancy Mae Cedo. - J. Franco Villanueva&
