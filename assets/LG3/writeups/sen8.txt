&dude=Pedro Andrew C. Beluang&
&writeup=Andrew is a true friend with a loving heart. This person is easy to get along with but sometimes likes to tease us. Actually, he’s also good in class but sometimes becomes lazy in studying. He also likes to play basketball with his friends. If you need help, he is always there to help. That’s why in the future he could be someone special and successful. - Michael C. Enguero&
