&writeup=One of Ateneo’s wackiest, anyone will be surprised that even at serious and critical times, Ige still finds time to laugh and make fun out of these problems. For him, life is fun and laughter. You will seldom see him in a gloomy face for he always cracks a joke. Humor is his game and that marks his personality. Once you get to know him, you’ll find out that in him lies a generous heart. - Niña Ramos&
