&writeup=Being the eldest among the siblings, “Nonoy”, as his family fondly calls him is a responsible, dedicated and dependable young boy. Even at an early age, you can see his conviction and determination in his studies because you will always find him studying after doing his household chores. He is also a gifted child because he has the ability to draw well. He gives thanks to God by praying the rosary daily together with his family. - Roselle  Don&
