&writeup=Carl is a young man with great honor, thoughts, political ideologies, life principles, and spirit. As a PMT Officer, he is fierce yet gentle to his men. As a student, he is acknowledged by the teachers for his aptness, spontaneity, intellect, and clear logical reasoning. In general, he is the best person I have ever met. – Marc Junan Gomez&
