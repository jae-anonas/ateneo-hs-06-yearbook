&writeup=Almi may be silent in class but noisy when his friends are around. He is an intelligent person, excellent in class and also a very nice person. Almi also likes to crack jokes on his friends; otherwise, his day will never be completed. If you have some problems, just call him and he will be there for you because he is a true friend. - Alvin Acuido&
