&writeup=Vincent thinks ahead of what others may slowly think about. He learns from his mistakes. and from these he makes people believe that everybody deserves another chance. Though he has a lot of burdens to carry, he cares about what he can share and he can give. He can't promise much but he does everything best. Most of the time, he's likely to sit for a while and reflect, but ends everything with a smile for he knows God is good. - Albert Neil Puncia&
