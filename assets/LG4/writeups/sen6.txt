&dude=Roy A. Aspe&
&writeup=At first glance, you might think of Roy as bully because of the serious looks from a military officer. But once you get to know him, you’ll discover Roy a friendly person that is easy to get along with. He is also funny. His comic personality, at times, changes the gloomy mood of the class to hilarious one. In general, he is a good person with a big heart for all. – Gil Andru Abrazado&
