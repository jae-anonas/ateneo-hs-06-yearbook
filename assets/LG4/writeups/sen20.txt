&writeup=Ric-ric is a very kind and a very responsible friend for me. He is the one whom I trust the most. Sometimes when we are getting late in our gimmicks some of our friends including me slept over in his house and we are given in his house so much care. Ricric is also our companion in playing basketball. Not only does he like playing basketball, he is loves giving pieces of advice and words of wisdom among us. - Dominic Saluna&
