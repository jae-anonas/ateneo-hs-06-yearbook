&writeup=I met Saho when we were in third year. My classmates he plays billiards well. I proved it right. We call him “Shao” – a funny name indeed. He is one of the funny students in the classroom. Sharing jokes and extraordinary feats is his habit. I mean they are part of his system. Comical as he is, he remains approachable anytime, all the time. – Ariel Oida&
