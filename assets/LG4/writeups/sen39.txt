&writeup=Like an electronic company, he makes things possible. He’s innovative, magical and deep. Being an Atenean, in fact, is one of his greatest achievements in Life. He will never say die at the end of every task or endeavor. He is totally toughened by his experiences in Ateneo. He’s the MAN! – Robert Eiffert&
