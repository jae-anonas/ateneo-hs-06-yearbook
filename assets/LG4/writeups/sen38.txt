&dude=Dominic S. Saluna&
&writeup=Dominic is one of my best friends I’ve ever met since first year and he is the one whom I know first. This person is kind and very responsible about his friends, projects and others that have to do with his success. We have the same favorites in doing things like calling voices, bullying classmates and other wrong doing in classroom. Because of that, I consider him as my best friend in classroom. - Marvin Sagales&
