&writeup=Hhmm…Mervin. Mervin is one of my bestfriends in Ateneo. I met him in first year and we have remained friends until now. I have proven his loyalty to our friendship in various incidences. He cheers me up and offers me pieces of advice. He even lends me money at times. He might be the personification of JOKER. All his body parts, from toe to head, make me laugh. He is a hardworking person. – Dominic Saluna&
