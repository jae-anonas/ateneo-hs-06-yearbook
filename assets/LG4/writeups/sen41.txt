&writeup=Everyone sees him playing soccer everyday, rain or shine. He is the person who loves to learn everything. He aims for the future and he never misses opportunities that pave the way for achieving his goal. Yet, he remains faithful to his motto “I LOVE MAMA”. According to him, he’s the most handsome in the family. He lives well to this blessing. Prying eyes of girls send him shivers from time to time. – Peter Paul Aspe&
