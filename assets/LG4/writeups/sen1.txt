&dude=Mary Franz L. Abainza&
&writeup=Franz is a girl with a very unique personality.  You can already tell her apart from all the other girls because of her curly looks, Mickey Mouse bag, and a smiling face. One thing though that sets her apart from any other is her being frank.  She will let you know what she really feels be it good or bad. This face will not make us wonder if Franz has a lot of friends, with that she gains the trust of people around her. - Niña Lauren Ramos&
