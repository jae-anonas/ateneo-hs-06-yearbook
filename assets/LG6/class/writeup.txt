&writeup=If the statement ONLY IN THE ATENEO will be exclusively used to tag any of the fourth year classes of 2006, surely it is appropriate for LG 4325. Why? The class has got a unique, queer, manly moderator and a bunch of students of varying personality, wits, temper, race, smell, height, voice pitch and tone. All these could be rolled in one – TATAK 4325 ni TAREDOTS.Even the poem “All Things Bright and Beautiful” (Cecil Frances Alexander) embodies the entire class. Everybody’s bright (academically and complexion wise) and beautiful (attractive, semi-attractive, annoying and “never mind”). Like the images in the poem, the class has “little flowers that open” and “little birds that sing.” There are “glowing colors”, i.e. “mestizos” of all shapes and colors (they’re not dogs). One thing great, everybody, through the intercession of the patriarchal moderator Arnold Redota, stick together as one. They celebrate their being an Atenean, their being creatures of God – be they human-like or dog-like.&
