&writeup=You might see this guy sitting in a corner with his mind somewhat floating in the air and seems like he’s out of this world but just wait for a few seconds and you’ll find out that this guy has a lot of things to say, to the point that you’ll doubt his masculinity. He’s silent yet effiecient worker - friend who laughs with you in times of merriment and helps you in times of distress. - Niña Ramos&
