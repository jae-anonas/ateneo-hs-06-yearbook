&writeup=I want to mark this girl for making my life here in Ateneo a very happy life. She taught me to be active in anything. She inspired me and gave me a friendship that I will treasure forever. She’s bright but she’s hiding it and all her other talents. Sometimes we fight because of it. - Joan Callo
