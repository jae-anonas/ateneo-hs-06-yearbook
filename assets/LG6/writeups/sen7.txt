&dude=Lawrence Raphael A. Bombase&
&writeup=Lawrence is a good boy… very, very good especially in playing chess! In fact, he was the champion in chess during our intramurals. He’s also a nice beadle (which our classmates can make some negotiations out of). He is also one of the funniest people in the class because of his hilarious personality. Lawrence is also a friendly guy in fact he has many friends. - Lani Bermudo&
