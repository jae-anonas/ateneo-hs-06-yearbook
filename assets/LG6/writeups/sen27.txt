&dude=Mark Joseph R. Rabela&
&writeup=Mark is easy-going, childish, a shy-type person, “the percussion lover”, “the semi-pogi” and an extrovert kiddo who loves listening to loud metal music that others refer to as “noise”. “Adik” to his closest friends, he often lives up to his nickname of being weird in his actions. His unique personality and choice of fashion will definitely be remembered for a lifetime. He is also named as “the Printer Hands” because of his very neat handwriting that is so neat that if it were your first time to see it you would think that it is computer printed. - Dennis German&
