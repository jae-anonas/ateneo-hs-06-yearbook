&writeup=I see this person responsible and honest. He has a heart of true friend. He is broad-minded and seldom ambiguous in his ideas. For me, a true Atenean in behavior and character is already present in this person - living and doing the code “Service for others” which is similar to the Ateneo conduct “Men and Women for others”. - Godrick R.
