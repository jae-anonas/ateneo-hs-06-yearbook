&dude=John Carlo F. Tria&
&writeup=This handsome, cute, and intelligent boy is a loving and supportive child to his mother. He never forgets about his friends and loved ones while he is focusing on his goal in life. Actually, he needs his friends because without them, this handsome, cute and intelligent guy will not be as if he is now. John Carlo is also special because he is given a talent of debating which makes him a terrible guy even though he is small. But height doesn’t matter anyway, what is really important is that he makes the persons around him smile especially his mother. - Mar Henrick Savilla&
