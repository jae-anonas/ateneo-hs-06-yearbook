&writeup=Pat, it’s what I call this guy. Pat is such a nice and caring guy aside from being a good-looking man. He is such a sweet person and making someone smile is his best asset. He always brightens up my day though he cannot brighten up his own. Pat loves teasing but when he teases you, don’t worry too much because to tell you honestly…that’s how he cares! - Angeli Ayo &
