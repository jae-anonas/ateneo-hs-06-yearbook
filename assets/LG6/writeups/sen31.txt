&writeup=Tall, dark and handsome are the best adjectives to describe this guy’s appearance. But the personality of this guy is hard to describe for only those people who know him well from toes until the tip of his hair can do that. He may appear tough and strong but inside he is soft and sentimental. He is a very loving brother and son. He could be sweet as an angel but with one false move he could be a devil in disguise. - Ann Garcera&
