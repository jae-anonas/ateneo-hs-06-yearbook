&dude=Ryan David I. Gumba&
&writeup=Kind! Ryan is a good vocalist not that I belong in the same band but because I’m a good listener. He’s also approachable in times of loneliness. Ryan, rock on! Just keep on rocking and maybe someday, we will be a grand champion on “GBOB” or Global Battle of The Bands. Rock on! - Gyno Alvarez&
