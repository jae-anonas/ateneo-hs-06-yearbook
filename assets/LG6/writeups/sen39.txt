&dude=Dodge B. Tolosa&
&writeup=Dodge is naturally a boy wonder. He tends to do things that others say that they can’t do. Rough in action but smooth in words is the often action I see in this person. He is funny and due to this ability, he fills the classroom with laughter even though he is timid. - James Dean Manalo&
