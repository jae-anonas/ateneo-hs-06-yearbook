&writeup=Our president supposed to write this write-up but unfortunately he wasn’t able to survive Ateneo. So the vice president took over and was forced to write this. There’s only one thing that people say when they hear “Lg: 4424”. They say “Mga tarantadong tatao sa lesson!” – may mapalag?- Tropang Nier, consists of Japong, Genesis and Jaja, control the Lg-4424. Without them there would be total chaos! So Lg-4424 is thankful to these people. But, Lg-4424’s unity and incredible cooperation make us the greatest Lg ever and also with the help of our moderator Sir Cresencio Beltran III. We survived Ateneo!!!&
