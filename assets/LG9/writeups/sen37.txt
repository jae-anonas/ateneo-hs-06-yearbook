&dude=Tristan R.Turiano&
&writeup=When you see him walking around, the first impression you would get is “astig” but when you get to know him, he’s kind of weird. Sometimes while I’m sitting beside him, he would laugh with no particular reason at all. If you get pass that, he’s a real nice guy, funny but sometimes freakish out of his mind especially during boring subjects and sir ******. He’s rich (he says he’s poor) and he has a bodyguard named Omar. All-in-all, he’s a good friend to be around with.&
