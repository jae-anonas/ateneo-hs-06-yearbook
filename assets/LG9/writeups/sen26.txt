&dude=Don Christopher A. Prades&
&writeup=Even though he’s one of the smallest guys in the school, he is cool. He knows a lot about computer games because he’s an addict on that field. King Prades is one of those people who is easy to get along with. For now, even though he looks like a first year student, he’s already in 4th year. I know you’ll graduate because you’re intelligent but only lazy. - Jon Peter Perdon&
