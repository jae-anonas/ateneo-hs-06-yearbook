&dude=Shiela Jamiro Septimo&
&writeup=A Cancer girl who possesses a strong personality that makes her stand out. Like the crab which symbolizes Cancer, Shiela shows a strong image wich won’t easily breakdown though faced with intense problems. She is much more aware of how she feels than what she thinks thus she cries easily when the heart starts to talk. She has the ability to sense other people’s needs and emotions thus people find it easy to get along with her. Though boyish in actions, this girl always show a caring aura and protects her love ones. The way she walks, how she smiles, how courageously Shie faces life’s challenges and how Shie offered herself to Manoy Jess makes her one “Astig” girl. - Yvete Marie Sola&
