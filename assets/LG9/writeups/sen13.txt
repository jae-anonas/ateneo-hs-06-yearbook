&writeup=Jasper Lyle Guinto, “Nier” as we often call him, is always at the start of laughter and smiles of the class when the class is at times of stress or problems. He finds way to make everyone in the class including the teacher laugh. He is a good friend in a way that he brings out the best in you and makes a great effort to make you feel one with everybody—that’s Nier—good friend, funny guy, energetic and smart. - Daniel Dominic De Leon&
