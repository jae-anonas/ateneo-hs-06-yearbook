&writeup=Well what should I say to you? Anyway, let me tell you something. You know bro, even though we failed to show that we are proud of you, we hope that you know that already. We are proud of you because after four years of studying, still you’ve made it because soon you’ll be graduating without causing much headache to our parents. You’ve passed the challenges, problems and trials with all your might. This is the moment to cherish the memories of high school days and welcome to look forward for another stages of your life. Your being consistent, hardworking and industrious brought you to where you are now. So never forget that in every step you made, we are there and God is with you everywhere. - Joyce Royales&
