&writeup=Kirk means “one who lives near a church.” He used to be a “knight of the altar” and a consistent service awardee during his elementary days at NPS. However, he was very depressed of being refused to join the “Days With the Lord”. His zodiac sign—Taurus has influenced him much as very friendly and a happy-go-lucky guy. But without you knowing, he is very affectionate and loving.&
