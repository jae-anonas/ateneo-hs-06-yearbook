&writeup=Dominic Garza, Sam as we call him, is one of the most aspiring students in the class. He always tells me that he would study in UP and aside from that, he believes that he would be able to attain his dreams. He is known as a positive thinker. He also believes that he would be outstanding in the College of Law. Someday, we’ll look at him at the success list of the batch and find Sam, the positive thinker. - Daniel Dominic De Leon&
