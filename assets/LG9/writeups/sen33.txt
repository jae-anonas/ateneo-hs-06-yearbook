&writeup= “Silent water runs deep…” as the saying goes. He is a guy who prefers not to talk too much. A typical shy guy to the other world but a wacky and humorous friend to his cliques. When you start talking to him, you’ll be surprised to know what kind of guy he is—talkative, fun to be with and hopeless romantic. Sometimes he acts like a little boy who loves to play and be satisfied with simple things he has. He is a man with a shadow of a young boy. - Mara Jane San Andres&
