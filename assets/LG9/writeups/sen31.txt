&writeup=My friend, Mr. Rosales, is a very kind guy. He helps me a lot in school. He’s a guy with a friendly personality which you can easily handle. Rosales is very fond of games. He’s good or better than I am. He’s a silent guy but also a cheerful guy. He has many friends—good friends and even loyal friends. He’s small but not terrible to eat giant cockroaches and rats. He is a beautiful and gorgeous guy.- Lyndon Celimen&
