&writeup=Paul Vincent P. Julianda, “Ger” as I call him, has been my classmate since 2nd year as well as a great friend. He has always been too energetic and playful. He always fools around with our classmates. Ger is best known for his being always there in hard and good times. He acts as the clown and the serious type. He makes us laugh in hard times. He listens attentively when we are in big trouble. - Daniel Dominic De Leon&
