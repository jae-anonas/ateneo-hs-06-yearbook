&writeup=Jaja is a guy you can depend on—form giving advice to cracking corny jokes. This guy has a lot of friends and I do mean—A LOT. He’s always surrounded by friends. There’s something about this guy that everybody seems to love, maybe it’s his crazy, loud and unique laughter or his charming smile that can melt anyone’s heart easily. This guy is a perfect gentleman. He knows exactly how to treat a lady. A guy who loves his family so much—especially his mom. - Niña Ramos&
