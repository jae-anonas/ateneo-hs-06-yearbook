&dude=Juan Cancio D. Dandal III&
&writeup=Cancio is a very timid guy. There is a part of him that other people don’t know. He is a good basketball player and a good artist. Although he’s not very attentive in class, he is very enthusiastic in basketball, 5’6” tall point-guard with an ankle-breaking crossover move and a couple of blocks and steal. He is our secret weapon. With his dark skin, girls fall for his attractive appearance and strong sex appeal. For more information, dial 361-77-94 and look for Pangga.- Ian Betito&
