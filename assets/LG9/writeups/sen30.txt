&writeup=Out of all the guys I’ve met in my life, this guy is the second when it comes to video game addiction. He is responsible but forgetful. Sometimes, he can be very lucky but he can also be stupid and lacks common sense. At first sight, he may look nice and quiet but when you get to know him, he can be sarcastic and noisy.&
