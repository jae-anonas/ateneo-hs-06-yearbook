&dude=Peter Paul A. Bataller&
&writeup=Peter Paul Bataller or “Toti”, as we call him, is the vocalist of our band, SYNTAX ERROR. He has a relatively thin singing voice for a male. Toti has been the greatest player in our band. His voice pulls up the band! Toti! Keep the good work and hopefully our band would last! Keep rockin’ and play your life at your best! - Jericho Andrew Savilla&
