&writeup=Kikoi, as I call him, has been a friend of mine since my first year here in Ateneo. He showed me the real meaning of friendship. For the past few years, he stood by in every hard time. He always finds new ways of making us laugh and he served as tutor matters about girls. He finds new ways how to strengthen the bonds between relationships. That is Kikoi, a friend and lifetime brother. In addition, Kikoi has a big potential on acquiring the best position in organizations because of his skills and abilities that is unquestionable. - Friendz&
