&dude=Ven Julio R. Requejo&
&writeup=In all the times that we have been with this person, we have known him as a mere tablemate at lunch and a seatmate during afternoon trip’s home. His teddy-bear physique is a skin to his big heart which gives generously, speaks of truth and opens to everybody. His booming voice speaks friendship and echoes simplicity and timidity. He may lose temper and be angry that easy but it only takes seconds for him to forgive. VJ is not a mere person, and companion, he is a TRUE friend. - Arvin Aller and Arnon Wong&
