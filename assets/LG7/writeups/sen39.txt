&writeup=This person never thinks of what is beneficial only for himself. Instead, he would make decisions which would benefit everybody. He is a friend who is always ready to help. A friend who is supportive, understanding and most of all, a friend who is true. Despite his fierce and serious looks, he is thoughtful and caring as a person can ever be. He is also the kind of person who can change the atmosphere whenever he likes to. His mood can affect how other people around him act. A man of mystery, a loving person and a man with a great love.&
