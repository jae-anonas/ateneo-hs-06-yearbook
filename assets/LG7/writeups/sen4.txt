&writeup=Mac-mac is just like those street children you would encounter in your daily life. He never leaves your side. In times of hardships, he is someone you could rely on. He’ll never fail to make you laugh out loud. He might be annoying sometimes, but we tell you, he has a very different and optimistic thoughts about life. You would have no regrets on having him as your remarkable and sensible friend. - Francis Xavier Verdadero&
