&dude=Antonio P. Delluza, Jr.&
&writeup=With a pure heart and a value for kindness, Anton is a good friend of us. We have been together for a long time and we can say that he is always there to be a wall that we can lean on. He never lets us experience sadness for he always wants us to be happy. Like everybody would say, Anton is the “clown” of the gang. That’s our friend that could win everybody’s heart. - Ralph Andrew Paglinawan and Gerry Patoc&
