&writeup=Mark is one of those who would just look at you with an empty stare with so much seriousness all over his face, but that’s when you don’t know him yet. He knows so much from his skills in the kitchen to ordinary everyday chores; he even sings beautifully. He may  be silent most of the time but what you’ll like most about him is that even though he is not speaking you could feel he is there for you, always. - Francis Xavier Verdadero&
