&writeup=“An average lady?”—maybe not. this pearl in the deep blue ocean is very rare and can only be discovered, if you dive and swim for her courageously. Her simplicity makes her one-of-a-kind,and her golden hands are not only for a pen, but for delicious experimentations in the kitchen. Her gentle mother touch can soothe, even the hardest heart of an aloof man. Her taciturnity even makes her life an open dictionary with all the beautiful and flattering words that will best describe her. – Marjun Gala&
