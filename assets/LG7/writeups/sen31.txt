&writeup=Gerry, a guy of happiness, has been a friend to us for a long time. He’s a bubbly person and he’ll never sense that everytime we see him, our day becomes great. You can see it in his face. His little smile, big cheeks and cute eyes enlighten us. His big heart never lets us down. He always startd a day with a smile; you’ll never see him with a long face. - Antonio Delluza&
