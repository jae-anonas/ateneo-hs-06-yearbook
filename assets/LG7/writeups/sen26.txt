&dude=Vincent Vaughn N. Navarez&
&writeup=This guy has a lot to say when the issue is about politics and social problems. No wonder if one day he will enter the field of public service. On the other hand, he is also outspoken and has the qualities of a good leadership. His sense of humor is also a factor or why he has a lot of friends. What one will certainly like best in him is his compassionate concern towards his friends and family.&
