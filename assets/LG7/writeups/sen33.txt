&writeup=Jeremy: 1.  A hopeless romantic guy who values what the heart feels than what the mind. 2.  A dreamer who puts passion in everything he does. 3.  A funny guy who loves making fun on his friends. 4.  A strong willed person who is willing to endure all the pain for his dreams. 5.  A fighter and a protector to all the people he loves. 6.  One of the best jokers around and will likely put a smile on every person’s face brought by his jokes. 7.  His chubby appearance and sweet smiles never fail him on putting up a smile on someone’s face. - Yvete Marie Sola&
