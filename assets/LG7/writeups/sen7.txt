&writeup=How do you describe a guy who has it all? Words can only approximate-never represent- the enormous assets this young man possesses. Ateneo definitely will never be the same again as this guy leaves its portals. His electrifying presence (what with his good looks, arresting manners, and gifted tongue) will sorely be missed by anyone who has had the chance to know him and appreciate his profound thoughts.&
