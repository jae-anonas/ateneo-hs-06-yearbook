&dude=Emman S. Buela&
&writeup=Here comes the jolly, young fellow with his backpack. Emman is an energetic, funny and talented student. He is fond of making fun with others and “boosting” their confidence whenever they are sad. But sometimes, many people think that Emman or Nyerks, as he is famous for, is annoying and only makes people get mad rather than happy. Yet, he is still one of the recognized jokers in our class. - Jeremy Saavedra&
