&writeup=A guy who could combine playing computer games, officership and studies, Igi is someone extra ordinary. Though most of his classmates and friends say he is bossy, he’s the “torpe” type of guy when it comes to his lady love. Igi is one cheerful guy. He is fond of telling jokes and playing pranks on his friends. Despite his “happy go-lucky” attitude, Igi is a serious son and a loving brother. - Jonathan Laxamana & Tatiana Fulgentes&
