&writeup=Silent, individualistic, and shy…that’s how he looks when you first set your eyes upon him in class. In the room, there you see him, sitting or standing alone in the corner staring outside the window. He doesn’t have a lot to say but there is something about him. He is an Atenean who dreams big dreams and thinks big but is surprisingly soft-spoken. Nevertheless, he makes a great friend one’s you’ve won his friendship. - Friends & classmates&
