&writeup=With seriousness and one hundred and one percent effort in his studies, he still has unique ways of dropping  his punchlines that will surely leave you  with the longest moments  of laughter. He may be losing his assignments in his big pile of documents, but he may never lure his being a good conversationalist with the twist of pretty humor. Unfortunately, this guy is seldom seen smiling and is often seen seemingly problematic but approach him and you’ll see what’s true—he’s perfectly fine. - Leandro Morte & Mark Kevin Borja&
