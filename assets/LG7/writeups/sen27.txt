&dude=Kaena Marie L. Nidea&
&writeup=Kaena has a pretty face with an even prettier attitude. She may be bossy and arrogant at times but that is exactly what makes her interesting. She is full of charisma and for those guys who know her, I’m pretty sure you’ll say the same. She is a true friend and truly you can depend on her. She is sweet, kind thoughtful and caring. By the way I’m not kidding. - Francis Xavier Verdadero&
