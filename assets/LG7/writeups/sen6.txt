&writeup=In the nook in class sits a naïve-looking guy. A look at him would make one admire his imperturbable  nature no one can upset. He is perfectly mindful of the price of time. For every eight drawings that class makes, he produces five. He knows how to handle things with poise, this modest young mark. Whose ambition is to lengthen his name with decorations like PhD or MA…all he cares about is his grade and that’s all he gets-grade. - Jose Rafael de Guzman&
