&writeup=Problems? Difficulties? Why face it all by yourself if you have a Jeff for a friend—one who can help you solve these problems and difficulties. Jeff is also shy, “tall, dark, and handsome”. He is a very nice person that even if he is busy working, he will try to help you. Jeff dreams big, does big thing and loves others no matter what other look like. That’s Jeff. – Mariel Federis&
