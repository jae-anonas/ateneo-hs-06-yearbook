&writeup=A very friendly person, the Mr. Ateneo 2005 is not just known for his stunning looks but prides himself of his talents and skills. Most people say he’s a very cheerful and high-spirited person. He is always ready to lend a helping hand and he always starts his day with a big smile on his face. He also has an optimism which is contagious but more than that, he is also understanding, upright and straight forward. - Michael Losa & Ven Julio Requejo&
