&moderator=CRUZETTE BALANE&
&writeup=The best picture of the class is this: in a divided canvass of red and blue where imps duel against angels stands the prettiest patroness lady, Ms. Cruz Balane. The scene is like a Sistine Chapel painting where she (Ms. Balane), the lady saving from damnation 4223 students, with hearts of varying weight, color and composition (fatty or lean hearts).Indeed, 4223 is a composition wrought from various personalities rolled into a unique, distinct, united entity pampered by the ever merciful and amiable Miss Cruzette. From her, the students learned compassion for the needy, service for the oppressed, and open-heartedness for the loveless. Despite differences, the students in the class have enriched themselves academically and spiritually in all the activities they had together – group studies, jams, get-togethers, and class outreaches to poor kids in the vicinity of Ateneo. Their being one for a year prepared them well for the next stage of their lives – college life – full of memories of togetherness.&
