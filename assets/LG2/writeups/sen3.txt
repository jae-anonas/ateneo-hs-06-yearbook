&dude=Michael Anton B. Alvarez&
&writeup=Gyno of Lomeda – this person that I met is a very kind and trust worthy person. He is the bassist of our band. Though his grades are not that high, he is very approachable. He is a guy from Jamaica (hehehe). He is really good not only because he is kind but also because he has a unique personality. I don’t know why he loves “Rastafananism” but whoever he is, he remains our friend. We will never forget you. AMEN! - Pido Destura&
