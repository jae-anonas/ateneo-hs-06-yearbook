&dude=Ghia B. Espiritu&
&writeup=Ghia is a person who has real enthusiasm for life and for people. She is a simple, friendly, young lady who speaks from the heart. She agrees to the idea of S. “The great high road of human welfare lies along the highway of steadfast well-doing, and they who are the most persistent; and working the freest spirit, well invariably be the most successful.” Inspired by the above quotation, she will continue her journey with confidence and high spirit. – Wendy Mendoza&
