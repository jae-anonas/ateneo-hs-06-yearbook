&dude=Robert Victor B. Escaro&
&writeup= A man of few words… this is what Rovic is all about. It is due to his life-long passion with the Lord. He also has the passion for music and poetry. This passion has inspired him to take up the six strings. After learning and mastering the guitar, he turned out to be a dark horse in the Naga City Rock scene, turning into a prodigal young gun with the six strings. - Lawrence Bombase&
