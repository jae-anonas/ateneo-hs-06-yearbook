&writeup=This basketball player who’s comely, adept and sensible is a big shot in my life. He considers his family priceless more than anything. Despite all his mistakes in life he knows how to redeem himself. His afflatus in God and all his felicities are attributed to him. When it comes to love, he has his own knacks for his girl and he believes that holding on means he love the girl regardless of the predicaments in their relationship. - Kathleen  Efondo&
