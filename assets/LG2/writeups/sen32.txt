&writeup=Silent, mysterious and kind these are the three words that best describe him. This guy is simple but not so simple. He loves to play basketball, which is his ticket to happiness. He also loves playing the guitar when he has nothing to do. As a friend I can not forget him because of the problems and happiness that we shared in this school. ANIMO ATENEO!!&
