&dude=Jan Michael A. Nebreja&
&writeup=He is a guy with few words. His name speaks itself as a religious guy with principles and virtues. A typical guy who lives next door who loves playing (MU)… Mysterious they say but if you’ll know him more he’s fun to be with. He is a trustworthy and humble friend. He loves to play games like chess. He also loves reading books. - Roselyn Nebreja & Allan Querubin&
