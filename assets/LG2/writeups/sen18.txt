&dude=Thomas Gael F. Gaite&
&writeup=Many consider him as a life down the drain… living the life of the impoverished amidst living in the backdrop of the material world. But this is not what Gael is all about. His life is a life of living a degree of humility… He has an angst-driven motivation to break through the barriers of real world scenarios. Gael is the complete and most ideal epitome of humility. - Rovic Escaro&
