&dude=Emmanuel P. Llorin&
&writeup=We often call him Wewe. He always tells jokes. When I first saw him, he looked very formal and honestly silent, but as time passes by he always makes us laugh with his crazy jokes. He always wears his bracelet at his left hand. He doesn’t want his hair cut shorter, he always wants his hair grow longer. Even though he is silent he is a member of a band. He is the lead guitarist but he often plays the rhythm.&
