&writeup=This internet addict is a “little-bit-of–this and a little-bit-of-that” type. He’s an all around friend for everyone. His face reveals that he is real. Although he’s with a serious look on his face, he is full of foolish thoughts which make him fun to be with. Some say that he is mysterious but he can shoot an arrow straight on one’s heart. - Sarah Monique Celebrado&
