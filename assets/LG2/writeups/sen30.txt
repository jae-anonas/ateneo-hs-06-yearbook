&dude=Allan C. Querubin&
&writeup=Mr. Allan C. Querubin is my seatmate. He likes beautiful girls and he also likes to play basketball. Allan is a handsome guy, lovable, kind and very supportive to anybody. He is a guy that you need if you have a problem because he can handle your problems. Allan is very quiet in class, maybe because he does not want the teacher to scold him or he doesn’t like it “talaga”. - Basyl Gregg Tena&
