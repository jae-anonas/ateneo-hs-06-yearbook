&writeup=Gilrick… he is such a nice guy. He always makes me laugh inside the classroom. He always sits beside me, that is why I am noisy too as I laugh at his jokes. He is always concerned about his looks especially wearing his shoes and accessories. He always admires his long hair and voice. He is also a member of the band called “No credit for today, for tomorrow okay.”– Macky Bernal&
