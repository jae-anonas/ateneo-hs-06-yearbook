&dude=Basyl Gregg M. Tena&
&writeup=Basyl is a kind Atenean who is confident on what words he says and what actions he does.  He is one of the people who are called as “small but terrible” because he is a good basketball player. And sometimes he is called as the MVP. For a short time, I realized that he has the knowledge because I see sometimes that he is joking but I know what he is saying is right. - Allan  Querubin&
