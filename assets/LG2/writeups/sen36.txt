&dude=Kenneth G. Taiño&
&writeup=No day would pass that this guy would bombard you with pranks and philosophical questions. With his analysis so great, this is one of those who could not be easily deceived. Kenneth is a total “techy” dude and anime fan whose main weakness is preventing himself from spending so much to satisfy his cravings for such. Before the tongues are talking about latest PC games, this guy is already half-way on getting bored of playing such games. - Tatiana Fulgentes&
