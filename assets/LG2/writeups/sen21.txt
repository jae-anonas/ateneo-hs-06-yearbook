&writeup=No one can contest the fact that this man’s life is lived by the virtues of simplicity and humility. Andrew views things as they are - no bells and no whistles. He deals with anything and everything direct to the point. What amazes me is that he does it with respect. He really is the epitome of the complete friend. - Je Serviano&
